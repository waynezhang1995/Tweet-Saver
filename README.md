# Tweet Saver

[Demo Link](http://web.uvic.ca/~waynez/Tweet-Saver/)

### Features

A simple webapp that allows users to save tweets to HTML 5 local storage by dragging and dropping. Users can search for tweets to save by putting in some text into a search field and clicking the search button to populate the left hand column with the 10 most recent twitter posts matching that criteria.

The user can then drag and drop tweets from the left hand column to column on the right labelled saved tweets. The saved tweets will get "saved" in the page so that when the user refreshes the page or comes back to it later his saved tweets are still present.
